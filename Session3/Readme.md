# Difference Between `npm` and `npx`

Both `npm` and `npx` are command-line tools that come with Node.js, but they serve different purposes.

| Feature             | `npm` (Node Package Manager)                                   | `npx` (Node Package Execute)                         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | Installs and manages packages                                 | Runs packages without installing                   |
| **Requires Installation?** | Yes, installs packages permanently                      | No, runs packages temporarily                      |
| **Use Case**       | Managing dependencies for projects                           | Running one-time commands or testing packages      |
| **Example**        | `npm install cowsay` (installs `cowsay`)                     | `npx cowsay "Hello, World!"` (runs `cowsay` once)  |

## Example Usage

### Installing a Package with `npm`
```sh
npm install cowsay
```
This installs the `cowsay` package locally. To use it, run:
```sh
npx cowsay "Hello, World!"
```

### Running a Package with `npx`
```sh
npx cowsay "Hello, World!"
```
This runs the `cowsay` package without permanently installing it.

### ✅ When to Use What?
- Use `npm` when you **want to install and manage** dependencies.
- Use `npx` when you **only need to run** a package **once**.


# Difference Between CommonJS and ES6 Modules

Both CommonJS and ES6 Modules are module systems in JavaScript, but they have key differences, especially in performance.

| Feature             | CommonJS (CJS)                                     | ES6 Modules (ESM)                                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Syntax**        | `const module = require('module')`                 | `import module from 'module'`                      |
| **Execution**      | Synchronous (blocking)                             | Asynchronous (non-blocking)                        |
| **Performance**    | Slower due to synchronous execution                | Faster due to parallel and deferred loading        |
| **Caching**       | Modules are cached after the first load            | Caching is limited, and imports are live-bound     |
| **Usage**         | Common in Node.js applications                      | Standard for modern web and Node.js development    |

## Example Usage

### Using CommonJS
```js
const fs = require('fs');
console.log('File system module loaded');
```

### Using ES6 Modules
```js
import fs from 'fs';
console.log('File system module loaded');
```

## Performance Considerations
- **CommonJS loads modules synchronously**, which can slow down large applications, especially if multiple modules depend on each other.
- **ES6 Modules support asynchronous loading**, making them more efficient for web applications and reducing startup time.
- **Live bindings in ES6 Modules** allow real-time updates, improving performance in dynamic applications.

### ✅ When to Use What?
- Use **CommonJS** for older Node.js applications or compatibility with legacy modules.
- Use **ES6 Modules** for modern applications to take advantage of performance improvements.

# Difference Between `.mjs` and `.js` Files

JavaScript files can have either a `.js` or `.mjs` extension, with key differences in module handling and execution.

| Feature             | `.js` (Normal JavaScript File)                      | `.mjs` (ES Module JavaScript File)                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Module Type**     | CommonJS by default (in Node.js)                   | ES6 Modules (ESM)                                  |
| **Syntax**         | Uses `require()` for imports                        | Uses `import` and `export`                        |
| **Execution**      | Synchronous (blocking)                              | Asynchronous (non-blocking)                       |
| **Performance**    | Slower due to synchronous execution                 | Faster due to parallel and deferred loading       |
| **Usage**          | Works in both Node.js and browsers                  | Works in modern browsers and Node.js (with ESM)   |

## Example Usage

### Using `.js` with CommonJS
```js
// main.js
const fs = require('fs');
console.log('CommonJS module loaded');
```

### Using `.mjs` with ES Modules
```js
// main.mjs
import fs from 'fs';
console.log('ES Module loaded');
```

## Performance Considerations
- **`.mjs` files use ES Modules**, which support asynchronous execution, improving performance in large applications.
- **`.js` files default to CommonJS in Node.js**, which loads modules synchronously, potentially slowing down execution.
- **Deferred and parallel loading in `.mjs`** allows better optimization for web applications.

### ✅ When to Use What?
- Use **`.js`** for legacy support and compatibility with CommonJS modules.
- Use **`.mjs`** for modern applications leveraging ES6 modules and better performance.
